## Happened this week

 - Did more work on hyper. Now at only 73 disabled tests remaining to fix.
 - Had meeting with XXXXXXX about tiny curl
 - Preparing for post-quantum curl and related blog post
 - Worked on moving a few mailing lists to new host. Many more to come.
 - Declined to appear physically at WebExpo in September, will do a video
   presentation about [curl on September
   21](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2021/talk/just-curl-it).
 - The WebSockets API discussions have faded but what we have now in the wiki
   is a design that might just work good enough for an initial take on
   supporting this protocol. If/when the next step will be taken I'm not
   sure.

## Blog posts
 - none

## Coming up
 - More services to move so that I can finally shut down my old server
 - More hyper work to do, and I figured out problems with transfer-encoding
   in curl I should address. Will also be good for the hyper test status.
 - It would be fun to get back to fix some of the worst HTTP/3 bugs that
   have now started to pile up
