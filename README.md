## HTTP Workshop

After three blog posts about it this week I don't think I can add much more
about the Workshop. This week was all about that, with us talking HTTP over
drinks until late several night. An intense massive HTTP overdose that has
really made my brain soft by the end of the week. Can recommend!

## curl feature window

While I have been neglecting several of my duties this week, I did manage to
formally open the curl "feature window". This means that we now allow the
merging changes and new feature for the pending next curl release.

A regression in curl's `NO_PROXY` handling was reason for a minor debate if we
should perhaps rather do an early patch-release instead of opening the feature
window, but ultimately we decided the bug is not *that* bad. It also gives us
plenty of time to make sure we fix it correctly.
