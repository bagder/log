# Daniel's weekly report

# May 6, 2022

## Happened this week

### Uncurled

[Announced](https://un.curl.dev)

### curl release

After the 7.83.0 release we received what can only be described as an
avalanche of security vulnerability reports. We immediately gave up the idea
of opening the feature window and instead readjusted our aim on doing a patch
release soon.

### Security

This week we have announced that the patch release will happen on May 11 and
that we have *at least* six new vulnerabilites to announce in association with
that release. This does not include the number of reports we worked on that we
dismissed as *not* security related, but there are a whole bunch of those as
well. Quite clearly several good and security oriented people decided to
scrutinize curl at the same time.

Analyzing, discussing, testing, debugging, documenting and patching these
issues have taken just about all my time since the previous release.

### curl up

The [agenda](https://github.com/curl/curl-up/wiki/2022) for June 6 is slowly
getting populated, but there are still several gaps we want to fill with
quality presentations. Let me know what subjects you can help out with!

We have two well-known sponsors lined up but not quite yet announced. Stay
tuned.

Thanks to sponsors, we will provide lunch.

### Daniel in the bay area

Tangentially related to curl up, but since I will fly over to San Francisco to
attend and present at curl up on June 6th, I will be in the general SF Bay
Area a few days following that event. I am in the process of nailing my
agenda, but if you want to arrange a meetup or something, do hit me up and
let's see what we can do. Might as well maximize my time there.

### WinCE

Customer XYZ got libcurl and wolfssl to build and run on WinCE 5.0 and after a
meeting with me Thursday, seem to be well on their way to get the combination
to work as well and thus targeted to meet their very tough deadline.
